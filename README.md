## About

This are the ~/.mutt/muttrc files I use on Mac and Linux.
Use at your own risk.

## Quick start

1. Install mutt with sidebar patch.

   On Ubuntu Linux 12.04:
   
   ```
   $ sudo apt-get install mutt-patched
   ```
   
   On Mac OS X with [*Homebrew*](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/):
   
   ```
   $ brew install mutt --sidebar-patch
   ```

2. Clone this repository.
    
   ```
   $ git clone https://github.com/mhubig/mutt.git ~/.mutt
   ```

3. Rename credentials.example to credentials.muttrc, and fill in
   your personal stuff. Don't forget to secure it!
   
   ```
   $ chmod 600 ~/.mutt/credentials.muttrc
   ```
